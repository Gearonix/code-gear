# Further Development

I'm not sure that the project will develop in the future.

The main goal of the project was to try a bunch of technologies and make it work.
And overall, I succeeded. 

In general, I planned to add more things, such as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/),
deployment to AWS, [docker-swarm](https://habr.com/ru/articles/659813/). 
I also planned to cover everything with [tests](./../features/testing)
as well, try DDD, make a cool landing page with framer-motion and
[threejs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) (currently actively studying). 

And maybe in the future I will do this. I stopped working on the project as it became
more of a chore than learning something new. 

If you liked it, don't forget to star it on [github](https://github.com/Gearonix/code-gear).
