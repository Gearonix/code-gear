# Authorization

The project has a regular JWT authorization via [passport.js](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport). 
Plus, refresh tokens and access token expiry have been added.

There is nothing unusual here, I would like to add that it was more difficult 
to do authorization with passport than to create it from scratch. lmao.

You can look at it in the `auth` microservice.
