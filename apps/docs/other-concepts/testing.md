# Testing

Unfortunately, at the moment the project is not covered by testing (only `storybook` test-runner).
If I continue to develop it, then it will be covered with testing.

In general, I planned to do 5 types of tests:

- Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) ❌
- RTL tests (Integration and Unit testing)  ❌
- e2e tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) [frontend]  ❌
- e2e tests with supertest [backend]  ❌
- storybook tests (storybook-test-runner) ✅

---

I wanted to try these technologies and test some components at the end of the project. 
But somehow it didn’t work out.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
