# Project Overview  ðŸ’«

## Why it is awesome?

[*CodeGear*](https://github.com/Gearonix/code-gear) is an *online code editor* (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) in which you
could conduct online interviews and edit code in real time with other people.

## Customization

It supports *10-15 themes* (including popular ones like [Monokai](https://monokai.pro/) or [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/))

Moreover, you can create your *own unique theme*.
You can customize the color, background, font size, tab size (default is 4 spaces) and much more!

## Functionality

You can *find*, *replace* text, create *tabs*,
and also *run your code* (`javascript` and `python` are currently supported).

::: tip NOTE

All your changes are saved to `localStorage` automatically, so you don't have to save your code manually.

## Real-time Changes

You can also log in and send a link to another person so that he can come in and edit the code with you in *real time*.

## What is the essence of this project?

In fact, the project was seen as an opportunity to try out a large number of different technologies.
And I succeeded - I created *an environment* in which you can experiment and introduce *new technologies* and functionality.

## Why are there so many configurations?

Firstly, I am an enjoyer of *complex solutions* and large projects.
Secondly, this was the goal of the project - to create *something unusual*, *large* and unlike ordinary pet projects. 
Something like that! ðŸš€ ðŸ’«
